# Physical Access Control Systems lab

Taking some of the PACS hardware from the [IT/OT Hack
Lab](https://github.com/thisismyrobot/IT-OT-hack-lab) to make a PACS training
lab. This will be based around [the red
box](https://github.com/thisismyrobot/IT-OT-hack-lab/blob/df48e1e9c3eb5dedd9a71def0c8c5bff6352a379/img/lab.jpg)
from the earliest iteration of that lab.

## Hardware
